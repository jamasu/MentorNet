TODO
1 change the logo image/banner to a flash/swf banner with images that slide from left to right
  Images should be about people in dialog, nature or abstract stuff, should blend with the color/images of the site

2 Scale down the todays Mentor Network logo to appear before home button, if possible change the white background of the logo with blue background in menu.

3 Change the footer background color to be same as the footer color in developers.google.com (dark gray)
